\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion:sec}

We present {\bf \tool}, a machine learning (ML)-based approach that
learns to untangle the changes in a commit. We develop a {\em novel
  code change clustering learning model} that learns to cluster the
code changes, represented by the embeddings, into different groups
with different concerns. {\tool} overcomes the key issue with the
static analysis approaches in which the boundaries across concerns in
a commit do not necessarily and naturally map to clustering criteria
of a clustering algorithm.  Our ML direction fits well with this
problem thanks to a methodology from Herzig {\em et
  al.}~\cite{kim-msr13} and Flexeme~\cite{flexeme-fse20}, to collect
the changes in the same concern and merge them to build the tangled
commits to form a training dataset.

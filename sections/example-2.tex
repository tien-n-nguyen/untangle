\subsubsection{Example 2}

Figure~\ref{fig:history} shows the changes committed at r1023 earlier
in JHotDraw. The changes at the lines 4, 7, and 10 of the
\code{Drawing} class were to the same statements as the ones in the
r1192 commit in Figure~\ref{fig:motiv-cc}. However, the commit at
r1023 was for only one concern as stated in the commit log {\em
  ``Fixes bugs in FigureStyleManager''}. This example motivates us to
build a ML model to learn from the co-changes for the same concern in
the version history to untangle the current commit.

  History of the co-changed statements with the same concern could be
  a good source for a machine learning model to learn to cluster the
  changed statements, thus, untangling the current commit}.

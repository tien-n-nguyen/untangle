\subsection{Research Questions}

To evaluate {\tool}, we seek to answer the following questions:

\noindent\textbf{RQ1. Comparative Study on C\# Dataset.}  How well does {\tool} perform in comparison with the state-of-the-art untangling approaches on C\# dataset?

\noindent\textbf{RQ2. Comparative study on Java Dataset.}  How well does {\tool} perform in comparison with the state-of-the-art untangling approaches on Java dataset?

\noindent\textbf{RQ3. Within Project Analysis.}
How well does {\tool} perform when doing training and testing in the same project.

\noindent\textbf{RQ3. Overlapping Analysis.}
What are the differences between the tangled commits that the state-of-the-art baseline can deal with and the tangled commits that {\tool} can deal with.

\noindent\textbf{RQ5. Sensitivity Analysis.} How do the key features affect the overall performance of {\tool}?

\noindent\textbf{RQ6. Case Study.}  How well does {\tool} perform in the real world cases?

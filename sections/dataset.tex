We have conducted our evaluation on two datasets. The first one is a
C\# dataset that has been used in the commit-untangling work,
Flexeme~\cite{flexeme-fse20}. This C\# dataset
contains 1,612 tangled commits created from 21k commits in 9 Github
projects. We use this~C\# dataset for all RQs except RQ2. In RQ2, to
evaluate {\tool} on Java and compare against the
state-of-the-art SmartCommit~\cite{smartcommit-fse21} (working on Java
only), we collected a new dataset by following the same process in
that paper. This Java dataset contains XXX tangled commits created
from XXk commits in XX open-source projects. The number of concerns
ranges from XX--XXX.

%We conduct our study on two datasets. One is for programming language C\# while the other is for Java's programming language. The C\# dataset is from the existing study from Partachi et al. \cite{flexeme-fse20}. The whole dataset contains 1612 tangled commits that are created from 21616 commits in 9 open source projects. This dataset has been used to do the evaluation for RQ1, RQ3, RQ4, and RQ5. The Java dataset is collected by us following exactly the same procedure in Shen et al.'s \cite{smartcommit-fse21} study. The dataset contains XX tangled commits that are created from XX commits in XX open source projects. This dataset is used to do the evaluation in RQ2.

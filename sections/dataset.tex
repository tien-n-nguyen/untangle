\subsection{Dataset}

We conduct our study on two datasets. One is for programming language C\# while the other is for Java's programming language. The C\# dataset is from the existing study from Partachi et al. \cite{flexeme-fse20}. The whole dataset contains 1612 tangled commits that are created from 21616 commits in 9 open source projects. This dataset has been used to do the evaluation for RQ1, RQ3, RQ4, and RQ5. The Java dataset is collected by us following exactly the same procedure in Shen et al.'s \cite{smartcommit-fse21} study. The dataset contains XX tangled commits that are created from XX commits in XX open source projects. This dataset is used to do the evaluation in RQ2.

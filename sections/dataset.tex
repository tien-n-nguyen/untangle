We have conducted our evaluation on two datasets. The first one is the
C\# dataset that has been used in a prior commit-untangling research,
Flexeme~\cite{flexeme-fse20}. This C\# dataset contains 1,612 tangled
commits created from 21k commits in 9 open-source projects. We use
this C\# dataset for all RQs except RQ2. To evaluate {\tool} on Java
in RQ2, we collected a new dataset by following the same procedure
from Shen {\em et al.}~\cite{smartcommit-fse21} since we aim to
compare {\tool} against their tool,
SmartCommit~\cite{smartcommit-fse21}. This Java dataset contains XXX
tangled commits created from XXk commits in XX open-source projects.

%We conduct our study on two datasets. One is for programming language C\# while the other is for Java's programming language. The C\# dataset is from the existing study from Partachi et al. \cite{flexeme-fse20}. The whole dataset contains 1612 tangled commits that are created from 21616 commits in 9 open source projects. This dataset has been used to do the evaluation for RQ1, RQ3, RQ4, and RQ5. The Java dataset is collected by us following exactly the same procedure in Shen et al.'s \cite{smartcommit-fse21} study. The dataset contains XX tangled commits that are created from XX commits in XX open source projects. This dataset is used to do the evaluation in RQ2.

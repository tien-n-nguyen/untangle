\subsubsection{Example 1}
\label{sec:example-1}

Figure~\ref{fig:motiv-cc} shows the changes at the commit r1192 of the
JHotDraw project with the log {\em ``Fixes NPE and implements
  indentation of~XML elements''}. This is a tangled commit with two
concerns/purposes: 1) the fix for Null Pointer Exception occurred at
lines 4,7, and 10 of the \code{Drawing} class (the \code{null}
argument was replaced with \code{Collections.empty\-List()}); 2) the
implementation of the indentation of XML elements occurred at lines
16--18, and a few other lines of code in the \code{SimpleXmlIO} class
and one line of code in the \code{Drawing} class (not shown).

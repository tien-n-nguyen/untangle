\subsection{Threats to Validity}
\label{threats:sec}

Our study is only on C\# and Java projects. However, the methodology
is language-independent. The datasets of tangle commits with the
ground truth of clusters were built artificially from the atomic
commits. However, this method to collect the data has been used in two
state-of-the-art commit-untangling approaches,
Flexeme~\cite{flexeme-fse20}, and Herzig {\em et
  al.}~\cite{kim-msr13}. In RQ1 and RQ2, all the commits in all
projects were sorted in the chronological order for the
experiments. Despite that we did not use the setting of leave-one-out
by project, our setting reflects the actual use of our tool in which
we can use all the commits in other projects that occurred before the
current commit.

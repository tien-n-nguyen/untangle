PHOG generalizes probabilistic context free grammars (PCFGs) by allowing conditioning of a production rule beyond the parent non-terminal, thus capturing rich contexts relevant to programs. Even though PHOG is more powerful than a PCFG, it can be learned from data just as efficiently. We trained a PHOG model on a large JavaScript code corpus and show that it is more precise than existing models, while similarly fast. As a result, PHOG can immediately benefit existing programming tools based on probabilistic models of code.}

PHOG generalizes probabilistic context free grammars (PCFGs) by allowing conditioning of a production rule beyond the parent non-terminal, thus capturing rich contexts relevant to programs. Even though PHOG is more powerful than a PCFG, it can be learned from data just as efficiently. We trained a PHOG model on a large JavaScript code corpus and show that it is more precise than existing models, while similarly fast. As a result, PHOG can immediately benefit existing programming tools based on probabilistic models of code.}

abstract = {We present a statistical debugging algorithm that isolates bugs in programs containing
multiple undiagnosed bugs. Earlier statistical algorithms that focus solely on identifying
predictors that correlate with program failure perform poorly when there are multiple
bugs. Our new technique separates the effects of different bugs and identifies predictors
that are associated with individual bugs. These predictors reveal both the circumstances
under which bugs occur as well as the frequencies of failure modes, making it easier
to prioritize debugging efforts. Our algorithm is validated using several case studies,
including examples in which the algorithm identified previously unknown, significant
crashing bugs in widely used systems.},
